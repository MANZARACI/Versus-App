# Versus-App

https://versus-app-manzaraci.vercel.app/

A social media site to compare things

  - Users can create posts called "Versus" that contains 2 items to compare
  - Each item has a name, an image, a comment section and a vote button
  - For each versus a user can only vote for only one of the items
  - Users can search for versuses and other users using the search bar

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

MongoDB Atlas is used as database.

Images are stored in Cloudinary.

## Required Environment Variables

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
